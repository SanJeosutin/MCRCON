# Minecraft RCON Web Application
Simple (and still barebone RCON) for Minecraft Server. 
##### **Only tested for Linux**

**Current Features**
 + Start Server through shell script
 + Basic Command Line Interface

**Working On**
+ Proper server status (ie: Player count, list of player, etc)
+ Much nicer UI
+ Faster response time
+ Login / account management system


## Getting RCON to run (with XAMPP :D)

 1. Installed [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) (*easier to setup imo*)
 2. Clone this repo and put it under `opt/lampp/htdocs`
 3. Run APACHE server
 4. Open up your preferred browser
 5. And start it on `localhost`
